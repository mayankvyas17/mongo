    "Deadlocks: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources that they hold. It is a situation where threads are unable to proceed because they are stuck in a circular dependency of resource acquisition. Deadlocks can result in a complete halt of the program.\n",
    "Example: Thread A holds resource X and requests resource Y, while Thread B holds resource Y and requests resource X. Both threads will be waiting indefinitely for the other to release the resource, leading to a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions: A race condition occurs when multiple threads access and manipulate shared data concurrently without proper synchronization. The final outcome of the data becomes dependent on the specific order and timing of thread execution, which is non-deterministic. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable and incorrect results.\n",
    "Example: Multiple threads increment a shared counter variable simultaneously. Due to the lack of proper synchronization, the threads may read and update the counter simultaneously, causing the increments to be lost or overwritten. The final value of the counter becomes incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid deadlocks, careful design of resource acquisition and release is required, along with proper synchronization techniques like locks or semaphores. To prevent race conditions, synchronization mechanisms should be used to ensure atomicity and consistency when multiple threads access shared data or resources."
